The BabyView camera is designed to collect high-resolution, at-home egocentric video data from children 6 - 30 months of age. The camera consists of a rotated GoPro Hero Black Bones attached to a lightweight baby safety helmet using a custom 3D-printed mount, powered by a rechargeable 9V battery.

The BabyView system was developed in collaboration with Daylight, Inc., a product design firm based in San Francisco, CA, and is the result of over a year of prototyping and field testing.

All materials—including design documentation, safety testing protocols, assembly instructions** (with detailed photos), pilot data, data management protocols, and sample participant instructions—are available on the [BabyView OSF page](https://osf.io/kwvxu/).

📄 Our paper detailing the design process is published in *Behavioral Research Methods* [here](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02206-1).  
📝 An open-access version is also available on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/238jk).  
📘 The detailed instruction manual for parents is linked on the OSF page and directly available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uODmIMQMlzofB-oz8A-zfd52h-UdplrrAQ6fKHX4THQ/edit).
